        <p>Hi, this is Anushka (they/them) from the cosmopolitan city of Kolkata, India. I am a trans nonbinary queer and brown person. I advocate for mental health awareness and the right to equity in all spheres of personal and professional lives and beyond for marginalised communities.</p>

        <p>By profession, I’m a full-time freelancer handling a diverse range of projects from copywriting b-roll texts and newsletters for a Singapore-based podcasting company to writing website content, location pages, Google My Business posts, etc. for US-based home service businesses, Indian travel websites, etc. for content marketing and SEO agencies. In addition, I am also a web developer.</p>

        <p>In 2022, I graduated with English Literature (British and Commonwealth) Hons from the distinguished Calcutta University. While my major was in English Literature, I opted for Bengali and Philosophy as my minors during this 3-years Bachelor’s degree.</p>
