        <p>“And, then suddenly it was all silent, and he looked so happy that this dirty crow was coming close. He didn't seem to care that it ran off with his lunch. And, I thought to myself how lonely is this guy that even a thieving crow brightens up his day?”</p>
        <p>Directed by Dorota Kobiela and Hugh Welchman, ‘Loving Vincent’ is the very first fully painted animated feature film. But this is not what made this film a worthwhile watch for me. Besides the absolute genius of the film’s animation style (reflecting the painting techniques of Vincent Van Gogh), a couple of things stood out for me.</p>
        <p>It’s how the narrator takes us on a spiralling journey of desperately attempting to prove Vincent’s death as a murder rather than a suicide;</p>
        <p>The terrifying morbidity of swinging back and forth - traversing life and death - navigating the turmoil of one’s own mental illnesses;</p>
        <p>How Vincent wrote to his brother Theo of his new-found lust for life, and shoots himself soon after;</p>
        <p>How he shoots himself in the middle of the field with not one soul to rescue him, yet drags himself back to his room - bleeding;</p>
        <p>‘Loving Vicent’ is not a film you should watch if you cannot stomach the violent realities, beauties, and loneliness of life, death, and everything in between.</p>
        
        <h3>Athhoi</h3>
        <h4>Genres: Action, Drama</h4>
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8kma29OKZw"><img src="https://www.ticketly.eu/Photos/Event/Event_40924.jpg" height="300" width="200" alt="movie poster of 'Athhoi'"/></a>
        
        <p>A contemporary retelling of Shakespeare's timeless tragedy Othello, ‘Athhoi’ is set in a modern Indian context highlighting classism, casteism, and social discrimination in many layers while exploring the intricacies of human emotions. ‘Athhoi’, starring Anirban Bhattacharya, Arna Mukhopadhyay, and Sohini Sarkar among others, is a nerve-wracking Bengali language thriller tragedy with a unique cinematic and narrative style.</p>
        <p>I watched this film in the theatre on a gloomy afternoon while I was basking in my solitary adventures one fine day. The film was adequately provocative to trigger my nervous system multiple times while I gasped for a hand to hold amid a crowd of strangers sitting alongside me in the darkness of the movie theatre.</p>
        <p>Anirban’s on-screen presentation of a self-righteous, privileged pervert haunting his childhood Dalit companion can make one want to peel their skin off, and quite rightfully so. Unlike a typical Shakespearean tragedy, ‘Athhoi’ brings the protagonist down from the pedestal and portrays him as a common man, making the sequences in the film particularly relatable.</p>

        <h3>Everything Everywhere All At Once</h3>
        <h4>Genres: Absurdist Fiction, Drama, Dark Comedy, Indie Film, Action, LGBT, Adventure</h4>
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxN1T1uxQ2g"><img src="https://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/048/625/284/large/andrew-sebastian-kwan-wb.jpg?1650510766" height="300" width="200" alt="movie poster of'Everything Everywhere All At Once'"/></a>
        
        <p>If you enjoy a good sci-fi absurdist dark comedy, ‘Everything Everywhere All At Once’, directed by Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert is a must-watch. While it hastens through several genres and film media, incorporating popular science fiction elements like the concept of parallel universes, this film also explores some notable philosophical themes like absurdism, surrealism, nihilism, and existentialism - making it an absolute treat for your imaginative capabilities.</p>
